    "description": "{link} is a fast, privacy-first epoch time converter and unix timestamp converter that turns raw timestamps into clear, readable dates. It also lets you convert timestamp to date, convert date back to epoch, and format results for APIs in seconds.",
    "builtForClarity": "Built for clarity",
    "clarityDescription": "Whether you have seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds, the epoch time converter detects the right precision so milliseconds to date is as effortless as seconds to date. Dedicated tools cover date to epoch, epoch to date, and epoch to {isoLink} for standards‑compliant outputs.",
    "standardsWeFollow": "Standards we follow",
    "standardsDescription": "{unixLink} represents the number of seconds elapsed since the Unix epoch, a widely used baseline in computing for logging and data interchange. For interoperable strings, outputs support {isoLink}, including UTC with the \"Z\" designator and numeric UTC offsets like +05:30, which makes integration with APIs and webhooks straightforward.",
    "timezones": "Time zones that just work",
    "timezonesDescription": "The site supports all IANA time zones {tzLink}, so you can render timestamps in precise regions like America/New York, Europe/London, Asia/Kolkata, or Australia/Sydney with correct daylight saving rules. Under the hood, conversions normalize to UTC and then format in your selected zone, ensuring consistency across {localesLink} and environments.",
    "privateByDesign": "Private by design, fast by default",
    "privateDescription": "Conversions run in the browser for speed and privacy, so your data doesn't leave your device. The UI stays minimal, with instant copy buttons, keyboard shortcuts, and accessible color contrast for uninterrupted workflows.",

    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "whatIsEpoch": {
      "question": "What is an epoch time converter and how do I use it?",
      "answer": "An {link} is a tool that helps you convert Unix timestamp (also called {epochLink}) into readable dates or times, and vice versa. Just enter your value to instantly see the result in your local time zone or UTC."
    },
    "convertTimestamp": {
      "question": "How do I convert a timestamp to date?",
      "answer": "Just paste your timestamp (be it in seconds, milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds) into the {link}, and instantly get a human-readable date and time for logging, APIs, or debugging outputs. It's that easy."
    },
    "whatIsEpochTime": {
      "question": "What is epoch time?",
      "answer": "{link}, often called Unix time/timestamp, is the count of elapsed seconds since 00:00:00 Coordinated Universal Time on 1 January 1970, excluding leap seconds; it provides a simple numeric representation of time for computers and APIs."
    },
    "epochVsUnix": {
      "question": "What's the difference between epoch time and Unix time?",
      "answer": "Both {epochLink} and {unixLink} refer to the same system, counting seconds since January 1, 1970 UTC (i.e. Unix epoch or the Epoch time); you can use a unix timestamp converter or epoch time converter for identical results."
    },
    "millisecondsToDate": {
      "question": "How can I convert milliseconds to date and what is \"current millis\"?",
      "answer": "Use the {link} for timestamps in milliseconds (13 digits); you can also check the current millis counter to get the exact epoch time in milliseconds right now—useful for programming and event logs."
    },
    "iso8601": {
      "question": "What is ISO 8601 format?",

    },
    "epochToIso": {
      "question": "How do I convert epoch time to ISO 8601 format?",
      "answer": "Just select {link}, paste your Unix timestamp, and you'll get an output like \"2025-11-05T10:27:11Z\" ready for use in APIs, webhooks, or any international data standards."
